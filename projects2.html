      <h2>Pitt Panthers Cloud Leaderboard (Pre Terraform)</h2>
      <p>
        Early serverless leaderboard built on AWS to handle real-time score submissions. This project was where I solved key infrastructure pain points for the first time, like API Gateway integration issues and persistent CORS headaches. It laid the groundwork for understanding how to build reliable client-to-backend communication in a fully serverless stack and prepared me for Infrastructure as Code adoption.

      <h2>Cloud Appointment System</h2>
      <p>
        Full-stack appointment scheduling platform simulating a healthcare scenario. This was my first serious multi-tier cloud build with frontend, backend, and DNS integration. I implemented automated deployments, monitoring, and a secure networking layer, which gave me hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines and managing distributed services. This project bridged the gap between basic deployments and production-grade infrastructure.

      <h2>Serverless Contact Form</h2>
      <p>
        Event-driven contact form pipeline designed to handle incoming submissions in real time without maintaining servers. Beyond just building a form, I focused on event processing, alerting, and observability. This project helped me understand serverless event flows, operational visibility, and the importance of designing for scale from the start.

      <h2>Static Website Deployment</h2>
      <p>
        My first hands-on cloud project. I deployed a static website using AWS services to learn the fundamentals of cloud hosting, content delivery, and optional domain configuration. This project gave me a practical foundation for understanding global distribution, caching, and cost-efficient deployment strategies.
